The coding quiz assignment was one of the more difficult assignments for me to complete. This assignment is still a work in progress so I do not consider this to be a compelete program. 

1. Instead of using text, I decided to use color to signify wrong answers. That decision is regretable and it needs to be changed. It results in a very ugly and primitive looking UI.

2. A different way of styling was used in this CSS using the  *::before and *::after selectors. It made some aspects of the formatting easier but also caused problems when trying to isolate and align my timer and highscores link.
 
3. There were issues when it came to ending the quiz. Instead of displaying a message or a score, one of the questions would appear outside of its container in plain text. No icons or navigable features show.

4. Buttons were implemented to allow the user to toggle from question to question. This is not a great method and it needs to be changed. 

5. The questions shuffle when retaking the quiz, which provides the user with a more varied experience. 

6. This project will be overhauled entirely and the current code will be amended to make it more functional, user friendly and asthetically pleasing.
